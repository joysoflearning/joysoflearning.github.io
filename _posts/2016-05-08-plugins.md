# Plugins!!

Vim is a very simple text-based Text-Editor which can be transformed into a powerful IDE using plugins.
This is the first of many posts I'll write about vim plugins one at a time and how to set them up fully for a truly satisfying
experience( custom tailored to *your* requirements ).

The first step to using vim plugins is finding them. You can find a list of trending vim plugins at [vimawesome](http://vimawesome.com).
Once you find a plugin, you have to install it. Most plugins have a README.md which you should read carefully before deciding to use them.
  > Maybe it requires an external dependency  
  > Maybe it needs a particular version of vim  
  > Maybe it requires NeoVim  

After deciding upon that, installation needs to be done via a plugin manager like [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) or [Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) or
[Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) ...

So now starting upon my theme of taking one plugin at a time and setting it up, let's start with plugin managers. I'll highlight installation
of a single plugin in Vim-Plug, the one I use and just brush up on the other plugin managers. For an example, the plugin we
will be installing alongside the plugin manager is -

[NERDCommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) - It adds superb commenting powers in vim

`Vim-Plug` is relatively newer so most plugins don't refer to its installation instructions. The example I have taken
is generic enough to consider most cases. The steps remain the same for all plugins, only the link changes and some
of the options I specified change.
So now onto Vim-Plug

## [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

A minimalist plugin manager and the one I use currently. Its features are highlighted at the top of
[README.md](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/blob/master/README.md).As per what I wrote previously, you really should check out the homepage, i.e, the README.md
and then decide whether this plugin is for you.

### Installation

This involves a single file, plug.vim, which needs to be loaded when Vim starts and hence
it is placed in `~/.vim/autoload`

{% highlight shell %}
$ curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
{% endhighlight %}

The plugin is fetched using `curl` which is a command line utility for downloading content from the web.
Now to install plugins, you need to add the relevant section in your `.vimrc`. For the example plugin:

{% highlight vim %}
call plug#begin(expand('~/.vim/bundle'))
" Use single quotes

Plug 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'
...
...
call plug#end()
{% endhighlight %}

So let's understand what I did here:

* called `plug#begin()` ( a function ) with an argument specifying where to install the plugins. Indicates that all lines
below this contain plugin options
* Used `Plug 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'` to specify the plugin. Most plugins are distributed via github repositories nowadays
so `'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'` is a shorthand for `https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter`
* called `plug#end()` to specify that no more plugins beyond this point

Here `~/.vim/bundle` is where the plugins get installed. After adding this to your `.vimrc`, fire up vim and run
`:PlugInstall`. This will start the installation in a side window with a nice progress bar while you can continue editing a file
due to the asynchronous install.

To update plugins, run `:PlugUpdate`

To uninstall a plugin, remove it from your vimrc and run `:PlugClean`

To update vim-plug itself, run `:PlugUpgrade`

Extensive options are available for customising the experience. Many examples of installing
are in the README.md with full documentation available by help.

Also for learning how to use a plugin, once a plugin is fetched, you are encouraged to read its documentation using
`:help plugin_name`, in this case `:help commenter`.

Advantages:

* Minimal and easy to use
* Highly customisable plugin loading
* Asynchronous install
* On demand plugin loading and hence faster startup time for vim

Disadvantages:

* None that bother me


## [Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

[Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) is the apparent successor of [Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) both by the same person - `Shougo`.

One of the main reasons why I liked `dein` is because it supports asynchronous installation/updating of plugins, something which `Vundle`
or `Pathogen` do not support. `Neobundle` provides this with the help of another plugin (`vimproc`), but I believe inbuilt support is better.

Advantages of using dein.vim:

* Asynchronous Installs like vim-plug
* Post installation hooks
* Only Loads relevant plugins for a certain filetype and hence vim starts up faster

Disadvantages:

* Relatively new and very little support
* Help docs might be confusing sometimes due to too many features

## [Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)

Since dein.vim is the newer version as mentioned [here](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim/blob/master/README.md),
I'll leave this out as deprecated

## [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

One of the oldest plugin managers for vim and hence it is slightly involved.
Pathogen works on the principle that most plugins are available from git repos,
so any git folder in `~/.vim/bundle` is a plugin and hence it needs to be added
to the `runtimepath` so that its data is loaded when vim fires up.

So coming to the advantages:

* Old and ancient and hence extensive support
* Very clean vimrc

Disadvantages:

* Requires extensive effort from user side( some might consider this an advantage because you actually
learn whats happening inside instead of an abstraction hiding it )
* Help tags not generated automatically, need to update manually, need to uninstall manually, etc.
* All plugins are loaded irrespective of filetype
* Asynchronous installs only if you can type asynchronously

## [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

The last but not the least, Vundle. Neobundle was a fork of this
with more features and has now become dein. This is one of the first
plugin managers I used, thanks to [Lakshay](https://lakshayg.github.io) and kept for a long time till I decided to switch
to Vim-Plug. This is very nice and easy to use but just a little outdated as compared to Vim-plug.

The reason why I shifted from **Vundle** to **VimPlug** was because of its synchronous(blocking)
install with no feedback on progress.

Advantages:

* Simple
* Automated updation and helptags generation

Disadvantages:

* Blocking install
* No post installation hooks
* Loads all plugins irrespective of filetype. Slower vim startup

## A more custom-tailored installation using Vim-Plug

*This portion is only for those who have some experience in vim*  
*If you are a vim learner, you may skip it right now*

[tern-for-vim](https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim) - It adds support for javascript in vim.  
*tern_for_vim requires nodejs. (This is just an example, you don't need to install this specifically)*

I am choosing this Plugin because it has a build step alongside the usual installation and is valid for only some file types.

{% highlight vim %}
call plug#begin(expand('~/.vim/bundle'))
" Use single quotes

Plug 'ternjs/tern_for_vim', {'do': 'npm install', 'for': ['javascript', 'foobarlang']}
...
...
call plug#end()

{% endhighlight %}

What I did here:

* called `plug#begin()` ( a function ) with an argument specifying where to install the plugins. Indicates that all lines
below this contain plugin options
* Used `Plug 'ternjs/tern_for_vim'` to specify the plugin. Most plugins are distributed via github repositories nowadays
so `'ternjs/tern_for_vim'` is a shorthand for `https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim`
* Now, if you read the README.md for `tern_for_vim`, it requires an additional step after installation, i.e., you
need to run `npm install` in its directory. Now, with other plugin managers, you will need to do this yourself but
`Vim-plug` offers the option to specify a `post-install-hook` i.e. the `'do'` which specifies what needs to be done
after fetching the source.
* I know that this plugin is useful only for javascript and foobarlang ( a super awesome language that can code the universe!! ).
So I denote that this plugin should only be loaded `'for'` `['javascript', 'foobarlang']`. If I did not specify this, it would have
been loaded for all filetypes, slowing down startup.

Apart from the two non-default options above, there are many more. So how will you come to know about them???
Read the help docs like I did at the github repo.

##### Example of advanced usage
`Vim-Plug` takes the concept of loading plugins to another level by having an option to load plugins only when I call a certain function.
For example let there be a plugin X which has a function Y. Now this plugin won't be loaded at vim startup. Instead it will be loaded
when I try to call the function Y. This plugin is valid for all filetypes but I only use it sometimes, so I set it up to only load
when the function is called.

## Ending

If you are a beginner in vim, I would suggest Vundle or Vim-Plug.
Pathogen is too ancient and dein.vim is too complex. On a personal note,
use vim plug as it has a simple interface for beginners and as and when you
grow more experienced, you can fine tune your plugins using it, as in the custom-tailored
example above. Even the pclub cordis use vim-plug. See [here](https://github.com/sakshamsharma/vivid-vim/blob/master/vimfiles/plugins.vim)
and [here](https://github.com/kunalapila/vimrc/blob/master/.vimrc)

## PS

I consider myself a novice in vim with only 30-40% knowledge. So if my views seem
biased towards Vundle or Vim-plug its because I used them. If there are any errors here,
feel free to correct me in the comments.
